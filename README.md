Boilerplate .NET Core API using JWT token. 

This was created mainly for a couple of projects that I was working on that needed this basic .NET Core architecture and easily integrates with Android clients using the ~~Firebase Auth~~ simple JWT. Also to learn a thing or two about the new Framework.

## What is JWT?
Seriously, read about it here: http://jwt.io

## Other things to know
~~It's using MySQL as database~~ Removing any db dependency, this project needs to be clear. 

## Missing features
- Entity Framework Migrations
- Tests (too lazy for that)

## Mentions
